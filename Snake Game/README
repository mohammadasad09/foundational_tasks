SNAKE GAME - TURTLE GRAPHICS IMPLEMENTATION (OOP)

Overview

* This project showcases an Object-Oriented Python implementation of the classic Snake Game, built using the Turtle graphics module.
* It demonstrates key OOP concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and modular design by structuring the code into multiple classes across four files. 
* The game is dynamic, interactive, and offers smooth gameplay, making it both a fun experience and a practical demonstration of OOP principles in Python.

Game Features
Object-Oriented Architecture: The game is structured across multiple classes:
  Snake: Handles the snake's movement, growth, and collision detection.
  Food: Manages the food's random spawning.
  Scoreboard: Tracks and displays the player's score, with updates in real-time. 
Each class is modular and reusable, allowing for efficient game updates and feature expansions.

Dynamic Gameplay
  The snake moves in real-time, reacting instantly to keyboard inputs (arrow keys). 
  Every time the snake consumes food, its length increases, raising the difficulty and the score.

Smooth Graphics and Animation
  Built using Python's Turtle graphics, the game runs smoothly at controlled frame rates, giving a responsive and polished experience.

Replay Feature: 
  Upon game over, the player is prompted to restart without needing to exit or relaunch the game.
  Input validation ensures smooth user interaction when choosing to replay.

How to Play
  Controls: Use the arrow keys to navigate the snake:
    Up Arrow: Move the snake upward.
    Down Arrow: Move the snake downward.
    Left Arrow: Turn the snake left.
    Right Arrow: Turn the snake right.

  Objective: Eat the food to grow the snake and increase your score. Avoid colliding with walls or your own body!

  Replay: If you hit a wall or the snake collides with itself, the game ends. You will be prompted to either replay or exit.
