U.S. States Game
This is an interactive Python game that tests your knowledge of U.S. states using the turtle and pandas libraries. Players are prompted to guess the names of U.S. states and see them appear on a map when correctly identified. At any point, players can exit the game, and the program will save the list of unguessed states to a file for later review.

Features
Interactive Map: A map of the U.S. is displayed, and each correctly guessed state is marked on the map.
Exit Option: You can exit the game at any time by entering "Exit."
Remaining States: Unidentified states are saved in a Remaining_states.csv file after exiting.
Requirements
Python 3.x
turtle and pandas libraries
Files:
blank_states_img.gif: Image of the U.S. map
50_states.csv: CSV file with states and their coordinates
