Higher or Lower Game - README

Overview

This Python project is a "Higher or Lower" game where players guess which of two Instagram accounts has more followers.
The game uses a dataset of Instagram accounts and their follower counts to randomly generate comparisons.

Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas library (`pip install pandas`)
- CSV file: `instagram_global_top_1000.csv` with columns: `Rank`, `Account`, `Title`, and `Followers`.

How to Play
1. Start: The game selects two random Instagram accounts.
2. Guess: Type '1' or '2' to guess which account has more followers.
3. Score: Correct guesses increase your score. The game continues with the winner of the previous round.
4. End: The game ends when a guess is wrong. Option to reset and play again.

Key Functionality
- Random Account Selection: The game picks two different Instagram accounts for comparison.
- User Input Validation: The game ensures the user provides valid input ('1' or '2').
- Dynamic Rounds: After each correct guess, the higher-follower account is reused in the next round.
- Score Tracking: The game keeps track of your score throughout a session.
- Game Reset: After each game, the user can choose to start a new game or quit.

Running the Game
1. Install dependencies: `pip install pandas`
2. Ensure the CSV file is correctly placed.
3. Run the script: `python <script_name>.py`

Enjoy the game!
